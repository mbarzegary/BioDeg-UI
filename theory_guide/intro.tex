\biodeg{} is an open source software written in FreeFEM (a domain-specific language for finite element programming), C++, and Python for modeling the degradation of metallic biomaterials and simulating the biodegradation behavior of medical devices, implants and scaffolds in corrosion experiments. It can handle any geometry of desire and supports parallel computing to simulate large scale models.

This document is an overview on the underlying equations, theories, and numerical implementations used in \biodeg{}. For more information, please refer to the papers published on \biodeg{}, which can be found in  section "Publications and referencing" in the \href{https://github.com/mbarzegary/BioDeg}{\biodeg{} repository}. Since \biodeg{} is developed initially for modeling of magnesium (Mg) degradation, this theory guide is focused on  Mg.
