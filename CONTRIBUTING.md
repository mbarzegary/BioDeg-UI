# Contributing

BioDeg has been initially developed as part of a PhD research project, but further contributions, either on the development of the core models or providing more supporting materials, are highly welcome. We welcome improvements, extensions, bug reports, and bug fixes to BioDeg!  

## How to Contribute

Anyone can contribute to the course repository via [pull requests][pull-requests].

We use [GitHub flow][github-flow] to manage changes:

1. Create a [fork][fork-explanation] of this repository, and [clone][clone-explanation] it to your local computer.
2. In your local copy of this repository, create a new [branch][branch-explanation].
3. Commit your changes to that branch.
4. Push the edits on that branch to your fork on GitHub.
5. Submit a pull request to the master repository (`mbarzegary/BioDeg-UI`).
6. If you receive feedback on your pull request,
make further commits to the new branch on your fork. These will automatically be added to
your pull request.
