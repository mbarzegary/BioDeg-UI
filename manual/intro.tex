\biodeg{} is an open-source software written in FreeFEM (a domain-specific language for finite element programming), C++, and Python for modeling the degradation of metallic biomaterials and simulating the biodegradation behavior of medical devices and implants in corrosion experiments. It can handle any geometry of desire and supports parallel computing to simulate large-scale models.
