The future versions of BioDeg will focus on implementing the following methodologies/features.
\begin{itemize}
\item Extending the core models to capture more complex chemistry of biodegradation by considering more reactions occurring in buffered solutions.

\item Adding support for more base materials like Fe and Zn.

\item Considering the effect of alloying elements and complex compositions.

\item Adding more post-processing features to \biodeg{} UI.

\item Adding basic visualization to \biodeg{} UI using ParaView Glance.

\item Improving the performance of fluid flow solver by employing a gradient-based solver.

\item Considering GPU support by enabling GPU computing in recent versions of PETSc.

\end{itemize}
